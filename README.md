# Associative-Processor-on-FPGA
Design of Associative Processor on FPGA
This project built a new FPGA implementation of associative processors. The design details of the architecture of the processor and its modules based on Verilog HDL are described. 
In file new, there are verilog HDL code, .v files of AP, 
and the DATA.txt is the data file for simulation,
and the ISA.txt is the instructions for simulation.
error1.txt is just to record some errors from vivado when I simulation, never mind this file.
And in the file ip, there are files generated by vivado when we add the MIG ip in the vivado.
